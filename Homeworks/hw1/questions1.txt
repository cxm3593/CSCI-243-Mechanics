1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

The path of that directory is /home/stull/sl6/cxm3593

2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

Command ls shows all contents of current file.

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

cd <directory name> will change the working directory.

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

mkdir <foldername> will create subdirectory.

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.
    
    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	:  2 points

Command -Wall is to display all warnings.
    
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.

        1. compute function did not return b variable so b is unsed.
        2. main function has one parameter but only void or two parameters are accepted.
        3. array z should not be zero sized.
        4. parameter argc is not used.
        5. compute function was not returning anything.
        6. x is declared but does not have any value initialized.
            
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
	does it catch in warning.c?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

        -Wextra should be the 'super-picky' warning flag. It enables extra warning flags that is not used by -Wall.
        -pedantic This one issue all warnings demanded by strict ISO C.


6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    -std=c99.
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
