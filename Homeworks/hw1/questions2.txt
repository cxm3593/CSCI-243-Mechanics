8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

        gcc -ggdb -std=c99 -wall -Wextra -pedantic -c <filename>
        -c is to compile it into object files
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

        gcc -std=c99 -o broken <filename>.o
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

        Because the a function name getArea was wrong in circle.c where it is getAreas so it could not be found.
